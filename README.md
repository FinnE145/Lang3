## What is Lang3?

Lang3 is a lightweight non-traditional OO language with static typing featuring comprehensive type prediction.

Objects are created flexibly with simple syntax that allows for many helpful features, including objects with a root value in addition to their properties.

Types are simple but allow for great customization, without the need for complicated structures like formal classes, interfaces, structs, etc. Instead, modify the properties and behaviours of any object (start with a generic obj for a new class, or start with something else to inherit itâ€™s properties). Then, use the type of your modified object in the rest of your code, as if you had created a class or a variety of other structures. The Lang3 type and object system allows for all OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc.

Functions have been given a revamp. Instead of rigid definitions, assign parameters (including special default arguments separate from the function itself) to a code block object. Call the code block directly, pass it to another function (with your desired arguments included!) or assign it to a variable/object or property for future use.

Loops, conditionals, and whatever structures you write yourself, utilize the flexible object system to save you time and effort. Use the powerful combination of value and properties to save yourself from writing the same simple code again and again, and get access to a variety of helper functions and utils built into the language and structures (or easily add your own). Additionally, a powerful and easy to use expansion and condensation operator is built into many parts of the language.

Lang3 also has a variety of small quality-of-life improvements to existing mainstream scripting languages, originating in both the core features of the language, the design and implementation of built-ins, and syntactic sugar.
